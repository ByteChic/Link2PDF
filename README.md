# Link2PDF

## Project Description
This project is a Chrome extension that allows users to convert webpages into PDF format. The user simply clicks on the extension icon while on the webpage they want to convert, and the extension handles the rest.

During the development of this project, several libraries and tools were evaluated for the PDF conversion process, including [html2pdf](https://ekoopmans.github.io/html2pdf.js/), [jspdf](https://parall.ax/products/jspdf), and [percollate](https://github.com/danburzo/percollate?tab=readme-ov-file). However, none of these tools perfectly met the project's requirements.

In the end, the [ConvertAPI](https://www.convertapi.com/) was used for the PDF conversion process. While this solution is relatively basic, it meets the project's current needs and provides a solid foundation for future improvements.

## Local Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your Chrome browser.
3. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch in the top right corner.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory of the cloned repository.

The extension should now be available for use in your Chrome/Brave browser.
